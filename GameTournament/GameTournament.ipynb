    "### Inspiration / Source / Backstory\n",
    "A friend of mine likes the videogame Hearthstone, and he had a question about the odds of winning a prize in an event they're running called \"Brawliseum\".\n",
    "Here's a link to the description on the fan wiki page:\n",

    "I'm going to structure the problem in a generic way and look at how to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "There is a game tournament in which each *admission* allows a player to play *games* until they either achieve $n$ wins, or $k$ losses, whichever comes first.  \n",
    "Players may re-enter, but each admission has a cost $c$.  \n",
    "Furthermore you may assume each game takes an average time $t$ to play.  \n",
    "Assume an average probability of winning a single game $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Values for the Backstory\n",
    "- $p = 50\\%$ (since for each winner, there is also a loser)\n",
    "- $n = 12$\n",
    "- $k = 3$\n",
    "- $c = \\$ 10$\n",
    "- $t = 10 \\mathrm{mins}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "- What is the probability, $\\mathrm{P}$, of winning the prize in a single admission?\n",
    "- What is the expected number of admissions, $\\mathrm{N}$, to win the prize?\n",
    "- What is the expected total cost, $\\mathrm{C}$, to win the prize?\n",
    "- What is the expected number of games, $\\mathrm{G}_{1}$, played in a single admission?\n",
    "- What is the expected number of games, $\\mathrm{G}$, played to win the prize?\n",
    "- What is the expected total time, $\\mathrm{T}$, it will take to win the prize?"
